Simple Self-Checkin-System with Flask framework.

However, it's important to note that Flask's built-in development server is suitable for development purposes only. When the system goes to a production environment, Flask may struggle to handle multiple requests efficiently. To address this issue, it is recommended to use Gunicorn for UNIX-based systems or Waitress for Windows. These production-ready servers are better equipped to manage concurrent requests and ensure the system's stability in a production setting.
